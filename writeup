📧 ParrotPost – Phishing Analysis

Platform: TryHackMe
Category: Social Engineering / Phishing Detection
Difficulty: Beginner – Intermediate

Introduction
Phishing continues to be one of the most prevalent social engineering techniques used by attackers to compromise credentials, distribute malware, and gain unauthorized access.
Rather than targeting technical vulnerabilities, phishing exploits human psychology to deceive users into taking harmful actions.

In this exercise, ParrotPost: Phishing Analysis, I carefully examined a suspicious email using a combination of technical inspection and contextual clues to assess its legitimacy.
The focus was on email header analysis, content review, and understanding attacker behavior—not on executing attacks.

Objectives
The primary goals of this exercise were to understand the typical structure of phishing emails, recognize common red flags within email content,
analyze email headers to verify sender authenticity, identify spoofing and impersonation techniques, and ultimately enhance real-world phishing detection skills.

Tools & Concepts Used
The analysis involved email header inspection, sender and domain verification, evaluation of embedded URLs and hyperlinks,
identification of social engineering indicators, and the application of logical reasoning and pattern recognition.

Scenario Overview
In this scenario, I was presented with an email purportedly sent by ParrotPost, a fictional email service provider.
The email urged the recipient to take immediate action—a classic phishing tactic designed to induce panic and bypass cautious judgment.
The task was to determine whether the email was legitimate or a malicious impersonation attempt.

Step-by-Step Analysis
The analysis began with a thorough review of the email content, where several warning signs were immediately apparent: the use of urgent language, 
threats of account suspension, generic salutations, and prompts to interact via embedded links.

Next, I examined the sender’s email address and noticed a discrepancy between the display name and the actual domain, with slight misspellings suggesting typosquatting—a clear impersonation tactic.

Further investigation into the email headers revealed mismatches in the Return-Path, irregularities in the Received fields, and failures in SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication,
confirming the email did not originate from an authorized ParrotPost server.

Finally, I inspected the embedded links without clicking them and found that the visible link text did not match the actual destination URL,
redirecting instead to an untrusted external domain—a strong indicator of credential harvesting.

Key Phishing Indicators Identified
Key red flags included the use of urgency to pressure the user, a mismatch between the displayed sender and the actual domain, impersonal greetings,
suspicious hyperlinks leading to unfamiliar domains, and email header anomalies indicating failed authentication.

Conclusion
Based on the cumulative evidence, the email was definitively classified as a phishing attempt impersonating ParrotPost.
This exercise highlighted how attackers leverage trust, urgency, and insufficient verification practices to carry out social engineering attacks.

Lessons Learned
Critical takeaways include the importance of never trusting an email based on appearance alone, always verifying sender domains and email headers,
recognizing urgency as a major warning sign, understanding that HTTPS does not equate to safety, and acknowledging that human awareness remains a vital layer of defense against phishing.
